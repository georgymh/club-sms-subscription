<h1> What this is, and what it does</h1>

  ClubSMS is an sms subscription service intended to be used by the OCC programming club. With this, members of the club are able to subscribe to a recurring SMS notification that will notify them of the start time for impending club meets.
  
<h2> Why we made it</h2>

  In order to prepare for an upcoming hackathon, our club decided to make use of meeting time to work on learning how to successfully implement foreign APIs. With this challenge in mind, we wanted to make something useful for both ourselves and future club members, so we decided to face the challenge of (chronically) late members.
